KafKaos is a real-time data processing pipeline designed to showcase the power of Apache Kafka and Databricks. This project ingests streaming data from Kafka, processes it using Spark Structured Streaming on Databricks, and stores the results in a Delta Lake for real-time analytics.

The goal is to simulate a robust, end-to-end system for handling high-velocity data streams, making it suitable for scenarios like monitoring website activity, tracking IoT device metrics, or analyzing transaction logs in real time.
